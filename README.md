A simple javascript XAHAU wallet to check the balance, send XAH, create new mainnet accounts offline and create testnet funded accounts. It uses the xrpl.js library.

Step by step guide to use the code:

1) Create an empty folder in your desktop and name it as you like.

2) Download the 4 files I have in this project to the previous folder.

3) Open the HTML file in your browser.

4) Select the network. It works for Mainnet and Testnet.

5) It allows to create a Mainnet account (which has to be activated later with XAH). Do it offline, it's purely mathematical.

6) It allows to create a Testnet funded account from the faucet. You can do it online as it's just testnet XAH.

7) It allows to send XAH.
