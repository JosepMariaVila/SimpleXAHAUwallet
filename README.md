A XAHAU wallet to create new mainnet accounts offline, create testnet funded accounts, check balances and send XAH. It uses the xrpl.js library.

It uses a seed to derive the account address and sign transactions.

Testnet accounts use the secp256k1 algorithm, so the wallet generates a 29 characters seed for testnet accounts.

Mainnet accounts use the ed25519 algorithm, so the wallet generates a 31 characters seed for mainnet accounts.

Step by step guide to use the code:

1) Create an empty folder in your desktop and name it as you like.

2) Download the 6 files I have in this project to that folder (or just download the folder and unzip it).

3) Open the HTML file in your browser (xahauwallet.html).

4) Select the network. It works for Mainnet and Testnet.

5) Click on "or create a Mainnet account" to create a Mainnet account (which has to be activated later with XAH). Do it offline, it's purely mathematical.

6) Click on "or create a Testnet account" to create a Testnet funded account with 1000 XAH from the faucet. You have to do it online as internet connection is needes, it isn't real XAH.

7) The wallet allows to send XAH.
